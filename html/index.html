        I'm currently a junior at the University of Nebraska-Omaha pursuing a Bachelor's in Business Administration. 
        Born and raised in Omaha, I have worked in hospitality, fast food, data entry, and nursing over the past few years.
        In the midst of those, I did occasional gigs as a Postmates and UberEats delivery driver and did Uber a few times.

        I've been learning programming languages off and on for 3 years now and decided to pursue a career in the emerging tech field during the pandemic. 
        When I was looking for a bootcamp, TrueCoders fit my criteria the best out of most that I looked at. The class sizes were just enough that you can learn from peers as well as get personalized help with instructors,
        great career coaching that starts immediately, and an overall close-knit community that celebrates your wins with you. I've seen the evolution of all my peers just within the 9 weeks of instruction and it's incredible!
        More than anything, I'm happy to be one of those great glow up stories!
